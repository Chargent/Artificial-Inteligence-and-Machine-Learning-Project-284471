## Introduction🚅🚝🚆🚂

Our project aims at augmenting the prediction of customer satisfaction for the ThomasTrain Company by integrating machine learinig and data science techniques with customer service insights. Our project dives into the "trains.csv" dataset, which encompasses a variety of variables including demographic details, travel information, and service ratings. The primary objective is to deduce customer satisfaction levels indirectly through analysis of the data, as opposed to relying solely on direct customer feedback, to effectively target users with promotions and making the retention higher.

In the initial phase, we conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to unearth trends and interconnections within the data. To prepare the dataset for effective machine learning modeling, we undertook several preprocessing steps such as filling in missing values, converting categorical data into a usable format, and eliminating data outliers. 

Our aim was to construct machine learning models that could accurately categorize customers into "satisfied" or "unsatisfied" groups, to grasp the nuanced factors influencing customer satisfaction. This was achieved through a combination of data preprocessing, analysis, and the application of machine learning techniques.

## Methods 🔍

Describe your proposed ideas (e.g., features, algorithm(s), 
training overview, design choices, etc.) and your environment so that: 
• A reader can understand why you made your design decisions and the 
reasons behind any other choice related to the project 
• A reader should be able to recreate your environment (e.g., conda list, 
conda envexport, etc.) 
• It may help to include a figure illustrating your ideas, e.g., a flowchart 
illustrating the steps in your machine learning system(s) 


## Experimental Design ✒️

Describe any experiments you conducted to 
demonstrate/validate the target contribution(s) of your project; indicate the 
following for each experiment: 
• The main purpose: 1-2 sentence high-level explanation 
• Baseline(s): describe the method(s) that you used to compare your work 
to 
• Evaluation Metrics(s): which ones did you use and why?


## Results 📑

Describe the following: 
• Main finding(s): report your final results and what you might conclude 
from your work 
• Include at least one placeholder figure and/or table for communicating 
your findings 
• All the figures containing results should be generated from the code


## Conclusions 💡

List some concluding remarks. In particular: 
• Summarize in one paragraph the take-away point from your work. 
• Include one paragraph to explain what questions may not be fully 
answered by your work as well as natural next steps for this direction of 
future work
